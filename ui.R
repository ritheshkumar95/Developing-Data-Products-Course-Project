<h1> mtcars Dataset Explorer</h1>

<p>
This Shiny app plots one variable in the mtcars dataset with another, with or without grouping using a third variable. <br> <br>

The variables are chosen interactively using selection inputs. (Variable on X Axis, Variable On Y-Axis, Grouping Variable) <br><br>

The plots are made using ggplot2 and rCharts. A smoothing curve is also plotted to show relationships. <br><br>
